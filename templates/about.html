        <p>To know me is to love me and to love me there are a few random facts you may or may not care to know about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am a food enthusiast, I <strong>LOVE</strong> food.</li>
            <li>I've recently discovered that web development may be my main area of interest in computing although i haven't really discovered my true passion.</li>
            <li>After taking a semester of French I have decided to continue learning because I've always wanted to learn the language and explore the French culture.
            J'adore le fran√ßais et je veux beaucoup apprendre.</li>
            <li>Lastly, there's a part of me that has always been really interested in photography and one of these days I'm going to pick up a camera and dive right in.</li>
